# Miwok-Learn-App

This is an Miwok language learning app made in Android Studio. This app enables users to learn basic Miwok language elements like numbers, common phrases, colors and family members.
This app helps to intoduce the user to the tradtional American Miwok language using clear audio files for the respected elements, which help to better understand the pronunciation 
as well as the accent of the language. Learning a language with the help of tradtional speaking audio is very critical here in this application.

This app was made possible from the Google's Nano Degree Program on Udacity, amazing course by Google for anyone inclined towards learning android app development.
